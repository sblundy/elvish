// Package cli provides the facility for building a readline-like CLI with very
// rich features.
//
// The current implementation involves a lot of wrappers and additional
// utilities, to avoid breaking the newedit package. Eventually, those changes
// will be moved upstream and the newedit package will be an Elvish binding for
// this package.
